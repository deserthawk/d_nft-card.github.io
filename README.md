## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The most difficult part of the nft card challenge was the hover effect on the image file. I've been researching how to do this and I've discovered that the best way is to reduce the transparency of the color I'm using, rather than reducing it. Therefore, the color hsla(178, 100%, 50%, 0.644) in the css code has turned into a use in this way.
